# Welcome to Pete Rai's GitHub Site

Here you will find demos of various things I have released on GitHub. I'll try
and put as much stuff here as I can, but life's a busy thing you know. Also, to
be fair, most of the code I produce these days belongs to my employer - so can't
share any of that. Nevertheless, over time you will see a pretty eclectic mix of
random projects dumped here.

_Enjoy!_

## Tech Idea Generator

Are you stuck for an idea for a new project? No worries! There is an endless supply of great ideas [here](https://pete-rai.github.io/tech-ideas/idea.html).

## jQuery SlideIn

A slide-in panel for jQueryUI that works from all four sides. The panel overlays your main page and can be slid in on a mouse click or mouse hover. There are lots of other options for customisation such as grab handle, slide speed, opacity, peeking-in etc. The plugin is excellent for housing user options which are only for occasional use, especially overlaid onto whole screen UIs that demand the entire screen real estate.

To find out more, check out the main [GitHub page](https://github.com/pete-rai/jquery-slidein) or try this [live demo](https://pete-rai.github.io/jquery-slidein/sample-slidein-full.html) or this [simpler demo](https://pete-rai.github.io/jquery-slidein/sample-slidein-basic.html).

## p5js Bubbles

A bubbles visualisation for p5js. A fun way to represent quantitative data as a set of bubbles
that grow, move and collide on the screen. Here are a couple of examples that you can use to understand how the visualisation looks:

* Click [here](https://pete-rai.github.io/p5js-bubbles/sample-bubbles.html?movies) to see an example based on _Top Grossing Movies_ (inflation adjusted)
* Click [here](https://pete-rai.github.io/p5js-bubbles/sample-bubbles.html?populations) to see an example based on _Country by Population_ (2016 figures)

## Alexa Skill : Boilerplate

A simple to use, boilerplate template for a new Alexa skill for the [Amazon Echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo). It's not really useful in its literal form, as it's real purpose is to show people how easy creating a custom skill can be. It basically allows your Echo to respond to utterances like "How does a duck go?" and Echo responds "Quack, Quack". It does this for a range of animals. It also responds to "Roll a Dice".

## Alexa Skill : Sky Plus

A connection between [Amazon Echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo) and [Sky Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky%2B) in the UK. Using this project you can create
a new Alexa skill which can respond to a range of requests to control you SkyPlus box. It
does this by posting key sequences directly to the box from the AWS cloud.

Here are the types of utterances this code can recognise and respond to. In each case, the response comes after the channel change. Many more combinations than this are possible using this code.

| Utterance | Response |
| --- | --- |
| Show me wildlife programs | This is Tiger Trail on the Discover Channel. It started 12 minutes ago. |
| Put on a game show | You're watching Family Fortunes on Challenge. It's been on for 22 minutes.  |
| Switch over to BBC 1 | Now tuned to Eastenders on BBC 1. It kicked off 14 minutes ago. |
