# Welcome to Pete Rai's GitHub Site

Here you will find demos of various things I have released on GitHub. I'll try
and put as much stuff as I can here, but life's a busy thing you know.

_Enjoy!_

## Karmaware

Go [here](https://pete-rai.github.io/karmaware) to read about this software tag.
Please do think about using the karmaware tag in your own software too.

## jQuery SlideIn

A slide-in panel for jQueryUI that works from all four sides. The panel overlays your main page and can be slid in on a mouse click or mouse hover. There are lots of other options for customisation such as grab handle, slide speed, opacity, peeking-in etc. The plugin is excellent for housing user options which are only for occasional use, especially overlaid onto whole screen UIs that demand the entire screen real estate.

To find out more check out the main [GitHub page](https://github.com/pete-rai/jquery-slidein) or try this [live demo](https://pete-rai.github.io/jquery-slidein/sample-slidein-full.html)
