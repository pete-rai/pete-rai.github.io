# Welcome to Pete Rai's GitHub Site

Here you will find demos of various things I have released on GitHub. I'll try
and put as much stuff here as I can, but life's a busy thing you know. Also, to
be fair, most of the code I produce these days belongs to my employer - so can't
share any of that. Nevertheless, over time you will see a pretty eclectic mix of
random projects dumped here.

_Enjoy!_

## jQuery SlideIn

A slide-in panel for jQueryUI that works from all four sides. The panel overlays your main page and can be slid in on a mouse click or mouse hover. There are lots of other options for customisation such as grab handle, slide speed, opacity, peeking-in etc. The plugin is excellent for housing user options which are only for occasional use, especially overlaid onto whole screen UIs that demand the entire screen real estate.

To find out more check out the main [GitHub page](https://github.com/pete-rai/jquery-slidein) or try this [live demo](https://pete-rai.github.io/jquery-slidein/sample-slidein-full.html) or this [simpler demo](https://pete-rai.github.io/jquery-slidein/sample-slidein-basic.html).

## Alexa Skill : Boilerplate

A simple to use, boilerplate template for a new Alexa skill for the [Amazon Echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo). It's not really useful in its literal form, as it's real purpose is to show people how easy creating a custom skill can be. It basically allows your Echo to respond to utterances like "How does a duck go?" and Echo responds "Quack, Quack". It does this for a range of animals. It also responds to "Roll a Dice".
