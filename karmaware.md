# Karmaware

So you're using software that someone created and released free-of-charge
with the _Karmaware_ tag. That means you are now honour-bound to spread
_good karma_ to someone else.

Maybe give something to that homeless guy you pass on the street sometimes. Why not
say hello to that old lady that lives alone on your street. If you have some spare cash,
you could even give someone the [gift of sight](https://donate.sightsavers.org/smxpatron/global/donate.html).
